                I have always aspired to become a professional in the field of Ethical Hacking and Red Team Operations. With 2 years of experience, I have acquired both theoretical and hands-on practical knowledge in Red and Blue Team Operations. My expertise includes Vulnerability Scanning, Penetration Testing, Web Application Security, Networking, and overall Security.
                <br><br>
                I am proud to have been awarded the Certified Penetration Tester achievement from RedTeam Hacker Academy and am currently pursuing the CEHv12 certification to further enhance my skills. Additionally, I've recently obtained the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, broadening my skills in this dynamic field.
                <br><br>
                In addition to my formal training, I actively participate in various Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and practical labs on platforms such as Hack The Box, Try Hack Me, and VulnHub. These activities have provided me with extensive hands-on experience and have sharpened my penetration testing abilities.
